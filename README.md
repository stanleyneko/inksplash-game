# inksplash-game

This is the first game I have ever made. I am just excited. 
To be honest, I did not think I could do it. I am surprised by myself.
The biggest challenge in this game was how to calculate the painted area. 
I use Canvas API to get RGB colour data to identify "white" and others and return true or false.
