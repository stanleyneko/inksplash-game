# inksplash-game

This is the first game I have ever made. I am just so excited. 
To be honest, I didn't think I could do it 2025 March. I am surprised by myself.
The biggest challenge in this game was how to calculate the painted area. 
My approach was to use the Canvas API to get RGB colour data to identify "white" or colour (not white).

I am a painter and my background is art so this is my dream, mergin my interests towards programming and art met. 

So please have a look and hope you enjoy it.
